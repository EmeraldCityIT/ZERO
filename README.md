# ZERO
ZERO is a battle operating system developed by Cory Andrew Hofstad which uses remote operators to develop instantaeous scripts and software applets during in-field operations. During battle, commands are sent to teams of active duty military and civilian experts. Software terminals are coding apps for mission functions while monitoring any mission changes using video, audio, satellite, radio, visual tracking, etc. Battle plans are common software applets. Changes to mission applets require new maps, routes, supply orders, features, bookings, etc. Diagrams for new hardware modifications, armor diagrams, and weapon designs are very popular applets.

Notes, video, audio, interviews, and reports are stored in ZERO's memory to create a permentant record. Evidence and conclusions take time to evaluate so reverse frequency is used to shorten time delays for processing information. Every possible battle outcome is input into ZERO's memory, literally allowing you to die and reverse time back to a safe point until a final battle solution can provides success.
