# ZERO
ZERO is a battle operating system developed by Cory Andrew Hofstad which uses remote operators to develop instantaeous scripts and software applets during in-field operations. During battle, commands are sent to teams of active duty military and civilian experts. Software terminals are coding apps for mission functions while monitoring any mission changes using video, audio, satellite, radio, visual tracking, etc. Battle plans are common software applets. Changes to mission applets require new maps, routes, supply orders, features, bookings, etc. Diagrams for new hardware modifications, armor diagrams, and weapon designs are very popular applets.
